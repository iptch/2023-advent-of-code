I solved part 2 on pen an paper (see the drawing.pdf).

Process:

1. Draw the graph based on the puzzle input
2. Think backwards: what would need to happen so that rx receives a low signal:
   - all 4 conjunction modules that are connected to vf need to send a high pulse at the same time
   - all 4 conjunction modules in the circles need to send a low pulse at the same time
   - all flip flops in a circle need to be in the ON state at the same time so that they all send a high signal
3. Think forwards: what happens when a low pulse is sent from the broadcaster to the circles?
   - the first flip flop in the circle switches between ON and OFF with every pulse
   - whenever it is switched OFF (every second pulse) it will send a low pulse to the next flip flop, causing it to switch
   - so the second flip flop in a circle will switch between ON and OFF every 4 pulses.
   - the third flip flop will only receive a low pulse every 8 pulses and so it takes 8 pulses until it is ON the first time.
   - if we continue this, we see that each flip flop needs 2ˆx pulses to switch ON, where x is the order of the flip flop in the circle.
4. Put it all together:
   - we see that only some of the flip flops send their signal to the conjunction module of the circle. So only these have to be ON at the same time.
   - we can find out the first time that this happens by summing up 2ˆx for the flip flops which are connected to the conjunction module.
   - instead of summing this up, we can write each circle as a bit string, and then translate this to decimal system.
   - For my puzzle input, I received four numbers: 4013, 4021, 3889, 3881
   - We can use the least common denominator to find out when it is the first time that all the circles are in the correct state.
   - We know that because, after one circle has arrived at this state, it will reset and repeat: the conjunction module sends back a low pulse to all the
     remaining flip flops that were not yet ON, resulting in all flip flops of the circles being ON. The conjunction module also sends
     a pulse back to the first flip flop of the circle. It must be a low pulse since all flip flops were in high state. So this low pulse will
     switch off the first flip flop in the circle and pass on the low pulse one by one, until all are switched off (which is equal to the
     initial state). Then everything starts again from the beginning.
